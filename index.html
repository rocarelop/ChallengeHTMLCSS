            <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2><br>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
                tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned
                browsers.</p><br>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and
the major browser creators.</p><br>
            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-
honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with
the web.</p>

            <h2>So What is This About?</h2><br>
            <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden
aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some
of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that
has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p><br>
            <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people
excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed
in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always
push it further.</p>
